This website represents just the beginning of my journey with Next.js, as I continue to make progress and expand my knowledge of Next.js and React.js. It's my first time exploring Next.js and Tailwind CSS, particularly as I have prior experience as an Angular developer. You can find all the code for this website on my GitHub page.",
